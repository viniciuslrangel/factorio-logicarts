[mod-setting-description]
logicarts-fuel-threshold=Cart should refuel at next available location when fuel level drops below this point.
logicarts-grass-wearing=Grass paths slowly wear to grass-4 (not dirt, just looks more worn out). A cosmetic change only but useful for remembering where carts are driving when constructing near by.
logicarts-deploy-seconds=Auto-deploy stops will periodically try to place a cart.
